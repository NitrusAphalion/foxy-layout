Features:
 - Drag and drop to organize windows
 - Rotate through possible layouts of the same drag position on a timer (Just drop when you see the one you want)
 - Resize multiple windows together
 - Bing all windows to front when one is clicked
 - Unique control center position PER WORKSPACE

Note: There are still some quirks for this running on multi-monitor and 4k setups.

You may need to update the NinjaTrader dll references to build -> build process should stick the dll in your bin/Custom folder -> Just launch NT8 and enjoy.
